## Hi there ðŸ‘‹Iâ€™m a cybersecurity enthusiast turned professional with a strong drive to explore, exploit, and secure. Whether Iâ€™m scanning for vulnerabilities, launching targeted exploits, or diving deep into network traffic, Iâ€™m most at home in the thick of hands-on security work.

My background spans penetration testing, network security, API hardening, and system vulnerability analysis, with practical experience gained through real-world projects and intensive training. Iâ€™ve worked across different environmentsâ€”from financial institutions to security labsâ€”using tools like Metasploit, Nmap, Wireshark, Nessus, Burp Suite, and Kali Linux to uncover and address threats before they become problems.
